 -> open two terminals in the root of project
 
 -> in first terminal write command "python backend/router.py"

SHORT DESCRIPTION:
The topic of this thesis was the creation of a system for profiling and data discovery. The system works so that the user enters data to access the database, and the system performs profiling of the tables within the database. Some of the functionalities covered by the system are: finding the most frequent values in a column, finding the primary key, recognizing a numeric value, date or OIB within a text column, etc. The system also has the ability to find potential foreign keys within the database, displaying probabilities and measures useful for further analysis. The system can receive a configuration file then based on it, select only certain relations and attributes in the database. The user uses the system through a simple and intuitive interface.
